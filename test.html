		<h2>About Zika</h2>
			<div id="text" style="font-size:18px;">Ever since appearing in late October of 2014, the Zika virus has been spreading around the world at an alarming rate. Affecting around 70+ countries, today the virus is responsible for thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of cases of microcephaly, a condition that causes the under-development of fetus brains. The Zika Virus, which is transmitted by mosquito bites, pregnancy, and bodily fluids, originated in Brazil, but has been transmitted all over the world, primarily through traveling, and contact with people who travel. The most common symptoms of the disease are fever, rash, joint pain, red and swollen eyes, muscle pain, and headaches. Currently, there is no cure for the virus, but world health organizations are actively learning more about it and how to treat it.

		<h2>Data Analysis</h2
			<div id="text" style="font-size:18px;">Our data shows just how far and fast the Zika virus has spread. While the first cases occurred in Brazil in late 2014, through the various types of transmission, the virus has spread over country lines and even continents. With our data,

We gave the computer multiple parameters, including world health ranking, GDP per capita, literacy rates, unemployment rates, percent of population below poverty line, and whether the country shares a border with an infected country. However, after receiving the data, the computer factored out the GDP per capita and literacy rates, deeming those attributes the most relevant to the data. The lower the GDP per capita and literacy rates, the higher the chance that the country would get Zika. The computer then, seeing the correlation between the statistics, predicted the countries that would most likely acquire Zika. If a country’s number is 0, represented by green, the computer predicted Zika would not become a national epidemic in that country. If a country’s number is .5, represented by yellow,  the computer predicted that country would most likely get Zika, based on their GDP per capita and literacy rate.
